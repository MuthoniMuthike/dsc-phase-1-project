# PHASE 1 PROJECT

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze box office data to provide actionable insights for Microsoft's new movie studio on what types of films to create and how to maximize revenue.

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they do not know anything about creating movies. This project seeks to explore the types of films that are currently doing the best at the box office and translate these findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio will use to help decide what type of films to create and how to maximize revenue.

### The Data

The findings of this project were derived from the below datasets which were loaded as dataframes for effective analysis:

'bom.movie_gross.csv.gz‘

'tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz‘

'tmdb.movies.csv.gz‘

'rt.reviews.tsv.gz‘

'rt.movie_info.tsv.gz‘

'im.db'


### Project Objectives

1. Identifying the most successful studios based on domestic and/or international gross.

2. Identifying which genres tend to have higher domestic and/or international gross.

3. Identifying the correlation between film production cost and it's box office success.

4. Investigating the relationship between ratings & reviews and box office success.


## DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION

To analyze the datasets for this project, I used descriptive statistics, which involved summarizing and presenting data in a meaningful way to gain insights and    understanding of the data. 

 I then used various data visualization techniques to explore the data and identify patterns and relationships between variables. 
 
 Let’s look at my observations from my analysis:

## Observation:

The movie industry is highly competitive with most studios earning modest gross revenue below 1 billion dollars and a few studios dominating the industry earning over 4 billion dollars.

## Observation:

The highest grossing movies are drama and comedy genres grossing at over 1 billion dollars.

## Observation:

Movies with a higher production budget tend to have higher gross revenues with only a few exemptions.

## Observation:

Although positive reviews and high ratings do not always reflect to box office success, movies with rave reviews and ratings tend to do better in the box office.



# RECOMMENDATIONS

My analysis led to four recommendations useful for the inception of Microsoft's new movie studio:

1. For Microsoft to succeed in the movie industry, they should seek to emulate the top 10 highest grossing studios through research and/or benchmarking or seek to partner with them.
 
2. There should be focus on producing drama, comedy, comedy|Drama and Drama|Mystery|Suspense genres as they are the most successful genres in terms of gross revenue.

3. Even though there are a few outliers in the production cost to total revenue visualization, Microsoft should invest in the film's production cost.This is because the movie industry is highly competitive and a larger budget often leads to better production which will lead to great reception and ultimately more box office success.

4. Microsoft's new movie studio should prioritize producing high-quality movies that receive positive reviews from critics and high ratings from the general audience because this will increase the likelihood of the films' financial success.


# NEXT STEPS

The movie industry is ever changing, so to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and insights, the further analysis below could be useful:

1. Analyze trends over time to provide valuable insights into which genres are growing or declining in popularity.
 
2. Look into the impact of streaming services in the movie industry.
 
3. Investigate the impact of marketing on box office success.

4. Analyze the success rate of sequels and franchises, originals and remakes.
